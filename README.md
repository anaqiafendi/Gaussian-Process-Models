# Gaussian-Process-Models

This poroject presents a gaussian process regressor based machine learning model for the prediction of phosphatase activity on a given substrate

Phosphotase_GPModel_V1.0 contains a completed model based on the Matern Kernel, it is very simplistic and is a baseline model
Phosphotase_GPModel_V2.0 is a work in progress
